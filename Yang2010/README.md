## About

Quick but not fully optimized MATLAB port of [1].

Feel free to modify and create a PR upon validating changes.

bfilter2 was taken from [2] and was made by [Mahmoud Afifi](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/authors/3544685-mahmoud-afifi). License for usage is available [here](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/62455-joint-bilateral-filter#license_modal).

Whenever possible I'll implement the method Yang himself used, described in [3].
